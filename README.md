# Pocket-Sized-Text-Reader
A smart System which shows the text file in a compartable display 
📦 Project Overview
This project converts a normal scientific calculator into a smart ESP32-based device using an ESP32-S3 Super Mini. It features a hidden OLED display, magnetic power control, Wi-Fi file upload, and low-power operation.

🧰 Components Used
ESP32-S3 Super Mini
128×32 OLED Display (I²C)
Reed Switch (magnetic power control)
450mAh Li-ion Battery
Scientific Calculator (donor body & buttons)
Wires, black electrical tape
USB-C cable
🔌 Pinout Used
OLED Display (I²C)
GPIO 10 → SDA
GPIO 11 → SCL
Calculator Buttons
GPIO 4
GPIO 5
GPIO 7
Only 3 GPIOs are used to for Up , Down and Enter/Exit Operation.

🛠️ Step-by-Step Build Process
1️⃣ Opening the Calculator
Carefully open the calculator casing without damaging the front keypad or PCB.

2️⃣ Identifying Button Pads
Use the image below to identify which calculator button pads are required.

Calculator Buttons

These pads will be connected to ESP32 GPIOs.

3️⃣ Tapping the Button Traces
Instead of individual buttons, traces are tapped directly to reduce wiring.

Tapped Traces

Carefully solder thin wires to these traces.

4️⃣ Connecting the ESP32-S3
Connect the button wires to GPIO 4, 5, and 7
Connect the OLED display to GPIO 10 (SDA) and GPIO 11 (SCL)
Circuit Diagram Ensure proper grounding and short wire lengths.

5️⃣ Power & Battery Setup
Battery positive → ESP32 power terminal
Battery negative → Reed switch → ESP32 GND
This allows the device to turn ON only when a magnet is nearby.

6️⃣ Fitting Components Inside the Case
Remove excess plastic from inside the calculator shell
Carefully place the ESP32, OLED, and battery
Use black electrical tape to hide the OLED from the front
Mark the visible text area beforehand.

7️⃣ Closing the Back Cover
The back cover will not fit immediately.

✔️ Apply patience and small adjustments ✔️ Avoid pressing directly on the OLED

Once adjusted, the cover fits securely.

📡 File Upload Process (Wi-Fi)
Power the calculator using the USB-C port
Go to the Wi-Fi Upload option on the device
Connect your phone/PC to the calculator’s Wi-Fi
Enter the password shown on the OLED
Open a browser and visit the IP address displayed
(Future upgrade: clickable text link on OLED)

Uploading Files
Only .txt files are supported
Click Upload, select file, and upload
File appears instantly on the calculator
Deleting Files
Reconnect to the calculator Wi-Fi
Open the same web interface
Delete files directly from the browser
🔋 Charging the Battery
Press & hold the panic button to turn off the screen
Bring a magnet near the reed switch
Blue LED ON → Battery charging
⏱️ 30 minutes charging ≈ 3+ hours backup
